# 📊 Patient Appointment No-Show Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes patient appointment attendance patterns to identify factors that contribute to no-shows (patients not showing up for their scheduled appointments).
By understanding these trends, healthcare providers can take data-driven actions to improve patient attendance, optimize scheduling, and reduce lost revenue.

The analysis and visualizations were created in Tableau using an open healthcare dataset.

## 🎯 Business Questions
Patient no-shows create significant challenges for healthcare providers. By analyzing no-show patterns, we can uncover who is most likely to miss appointments, when it happens most often, and why, enabling targeted interventions such as reminder systems, scheduling adjustments, and patient education.

🔎 Before analysis, the following questions guided the project:

- What is the overall patient no-show rate?

- Which demographic groups (age, gender) have the highest no-show rates?

- How does the day of the week impact patient attendance?

- At what times of day are no-shows most common?

- How effective are SMS reminders in reducing no-shows?

## 📌 Key Insights

📊 Key Insights
1️⃣ Total Visits 🏥

The dataset shows X,XXX total appointments during the analyzed period.

A significant portion of visits occur on [most common day], suggesting scheduling patterns or operational preferences.

2️⃣ Day of the Week Trends 📅

[Highest day] has the most visits, possibly linked to post-weekend checkups or clinic availability.

[Lowest day] sees fewer appointments, which might be due to reduced hours or patient preferences.

3️⃣ Age Group Distribution 👶🧑‍🦳

The largest patient segment is [dominant age group], making up XX% of total visits.

Younger patients (<18) have lower visit counts, while older adults (60+) show higher attendance for regular checkups.

4️⃣ No-Show Rate 🚫

X% of all scheduled appointments resulted in no-shows, impacting resource planning and patient care efficiency.

No-shows are more common in [specific age group or day].

5️⃣ Gender Breakdown 🚹🚺

Visits are slightly skewed towards [Male/Female] patients at XX% vs. XX%.


## 💡 Recommendations
✅ Optimize Staffing by Peak Days

Increase staff availability on [peak days] to handle higher patient volume.

✅ Targeted Reminders for High No-Show Groups

Use SMS or app notifications for [age/day group] with the highest no-show rates.

✅ Flexible Scheduling for Older Patients

Offer earlier appointment slots for seniors to match preferred visit times.

✅ Encourage Visits on Low-Traffic Days

Provide incentives or awareness campaigns for patients to book on [lowest day] to balance workload.

✅ Gender-Specific Health Programs

Consider outreach or health packages tailored for the gender with lower attendance to improve engagement.
