# 📊 Patient Appointment No-Show Analysis

#📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes patient appointment attendance patterns to identify factors that contribute to no-shows (patients not showing up for their scheduled appointments).
By understanding these trends, healthcare providers can take data-driven actions to improve patient attendance, optimize scheduling, and reduce lost revenue.

The analysis and visualizations were created in Tableau using an open healthcare dataset.
The resulting dashboard provides actionable insights for operational and patient engagement strategies.

# 🎯 Business Problem
Patient no-shows create significant challenges for healthcare providers:

Lost revenue from unused appointment slots

Increased wait times for other patients

Inefficient use of staff and resources

Potential negative impact on patient health outcomes

By analyzing no-show patterns, we can uncover who is most likely to miss appointments, when it happens most often, and why, enabling targeted interventions such as reminder systems, scheduling adjustments, and patient education.

#❓ Business Questions

Before analysis, the following questions guided the project:

- What is the overall patient no-show rate?

- Which demographic groups (age, gender) have the highest no-show rates?

- How does the day of the week impact patient attendance?

- At what times of day are no-shows most common?

- How effective are SMS reminders in reducing no-shows?
