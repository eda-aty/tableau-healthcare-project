# 📊 Patient Appointment No-Show Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes patient appointment attendance patterns to identify factors that contribute to no-shows (patients not showing up for their scheduled appointments).
By understanding these trends, healthcare providers can take data-driven actions to improve patient attendance, optimize scheduling, and reduce lost revenue.

The analysis and visualizations were created in Tableau using an open healthcare dataset.

## 🎯 Business Questions
Patient no-shows create significant challenges for healthcare providers. By analyzing no-show patterns, we can uncover who is most likely to miss appointments, when it happens most often, and why, enabling targeted interventions such as reminder systems, scheduling adjustments, and patient education.

🔎 Before analysis, the following questions guided the project:

- What is the overall patient no-show rate?

- Which demographic groups (age, gender) have the highest no-show rates?

- How does the day of the week impact patient attendance?

- At what times of day are no-shows most common?

- How effective are SMS reminders in reducing no-shows?

## 📌 Key Insights

📊 Key Insights

1️⃣ Patient Volume & Attendance

* Total Unique Patients: 62,294
* Attended Visits: 110,527
* No-Show Rate: 20.2% — This is relatively high and suggests an operational efficiency gap.
* Implication: 1 in 5 scheduled patients do not attend their appointments.

2️⃣ Appointment Trends (Daily)📅

* Pattern: Appointment volumes peak early in the month (days 2–6) and then stabilize at a lower level.

3️⃣ Gender Comparison 🚹🚺

* Attendance rates for Female (F) and Male (M) patients are similar — no major gender-based difference.

4️⃣ SMS Reminder Impact  📲 ✅

* Patients receiving SMS reminders show higher attendance (lower no-show rates).

5️⃣ Day of Week Visit by Age Group 👶🧑‍🦳

* Highest Volume Days: Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday (in that order).
* Lowest Volume Days: Saturday (almost negligible) and Thursday.
* Age Group Trends:
    * 0–18 years have the highest total visits.
    * 76+ years have the lowest visit activity

6️⃣ Weekday Trend of Appointments ⏳
